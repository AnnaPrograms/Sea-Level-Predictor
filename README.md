# Sea-Level-Predictor
A short program that using scipy linregress to show the trend of the rising sea level.

I use scipy, matplotlib, pandas, and numpy to create a short visulization of the rising sea level. There is multiple graphs on the plot, I first graphed the original data as a scatter plot, the x axis is the years, and the y axis is the CSIRO Adjusted Sea Level, I preceded to use the linregress function from scipy.stats to get the slope and y-intercept of the line of best fit, which is the red line. I also added a green new line of best fit only using the the data from 2000 to the most recent year. 

(The csv dataset I used is also available)
